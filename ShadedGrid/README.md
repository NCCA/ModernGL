# ShadedGrid

In this demo an array of Grid Vertices are generated, and updated each frame (this is the sort of thing you would do in a cloth sim for example). The vertices are then rendered as a shaded grid, with the new position and normals being calculated each frame and updated in the vertex buffer.
